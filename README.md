The goal of the assignment is to refactor, make it more accessible and fix mistakes
A couple of changes I found and made
   Search Engine Optimization link did not fully work, when clicked on it did not take you to bottom part of page
   Pictures did not have "alt" tags assigned
   I added "hover" tags to make links appear bigger when hovered over
   Also had social media links for people to follow and get a bigger fan base
   Implemented code to make website mobile accessible
