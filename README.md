The goal of the assignment is to refactor and make it more accessible 
A couple of changes I found and made
   Search Engine Optimization link did not fully work, when clicked on it did not take you to bottom part of page
   Pictures did not have "alt" tags assigned
   I added "hover" tags to make links appear bigger when hovered over
   Also had social media links for people to follow and get closer to customer 
   There was a pattern of codes that were combined to clean up the css code.
